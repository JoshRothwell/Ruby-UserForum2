<h1>Welcome to the Design Patterns Forum!</h1>
    <!--This is meant to be an attempt at implementing the template design pattern via a information page
    , functionally it's really no different than the other pages, so I'm pursueing a different design pattern.-->

<p>
  This page provides information about the design patterns used in our application.
</p>

<p>
  We have employed the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, which separates the application logic into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller.
</p>

<p>
  The MVC pattern helps us achieve a clear separation of concerns and promotes maintainability and extensibility of our codebase.
