# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the "{}" from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

one:
  email: user1@example.com
  username: User1
  encrypted_password: <%= BCrypt::Password.create('password1') %>

two:
  email: user2@example.com
  username: User2
  encrypted_password: <%= BCrypt::Password.create('password2') %>
